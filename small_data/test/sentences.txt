Argentina benefits from rich natural resources , a highly literate population , an export-oriented agricultural sector , and a diversified industrial base .
Although one of the world 's wealthiest countries 100 years ago , Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises , persistent fiscal and current account deficits , high inflation , mounting external debt , and capital flight .
A severe depression , growing public and external indebtedness , and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic , social , and political crisis in the country 's turbulent history .
Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - the largest in history - on the government 's foreign debt in December of that year , and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office .
His successor , Eduardo DUHALDE , announced an end to the peso 's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002 .
The economy bottomed out that year , with real GDP 18 % smaller than in 1998 and almost 60 % of Argentines under the poverty line .
Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5 % annually over the subsequent six years , taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor , an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden , excellent international financial conditions , and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies .
Inflation also increased , however , during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER , which responded with price restraints on businesses , as well as export taxes and restraints , and beginning in early 2007 , with understating inflation data .
Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007 , and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession .
The economy has rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession , but the government 's continued reliance on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already high inflation .
The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture - primarily bananas - in years past , but increasingly has been driven by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an " ecotourism " destination .
In order to diversify the island 's production base , the government also is attempting to develop an offshore financial sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to develop geothermal energy resources .
In 2003 , the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including elimination of price controls , privatization of the state banana company , and tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet IMF requirements .
This restructuring paved the way for an economic recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high - and helped to reduce the debt burden , which remains at about 85 % of GDP .
Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages equivalent to 20 % of GDP .
In 2009 , growth slowed as a result of the global recession ; it picked up only slightly in 2010 .
Burundi is a landlocked , resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector .
The economy is predominantly agricultural which accounts for just over 30 % of GDP and employs more than 90 % of the population .
Burundi 's primary exports are coffee and tea , which account for 90 % of foreign exchange earnings , though exports are a relatively small share of GDP .
Burundi 's export earnings - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices .
The Tutsi minority , 14 % of the population , dominates the coffee trade .
An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more than 2,00,000 deaths , forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania , and displaced 1,40,000 others internally .
Only one in two children go to school , and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV / AIDS .
Food , medicine , and electricity remain in short supply .
Less than 2 % of the population has electricity in its homes .
Burundi 's GDP grew around 4 % annually in 2006 - 10 .
Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased , but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate , poor education rates , a weak legal system , a poor transportation network , overburdened utilities , and low administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms .
The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation .
Burundi will continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors ; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government 's revenues and its ability to pay salaries .
Burundi joined the East African Community , which should boost Burundi 's regional trade ties , and received $ 700 million in debt relief in 2009 .
Government corruption is also hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever-changing rules .
